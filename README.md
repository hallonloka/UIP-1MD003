# UIP-1MD003 - Coffee Clicker

## Project Overview
This project is part of the UIP2 course. It is a simple interactive game similar to the popular application Cookie Clicker. The purpose of the development was to implement and learn interactive graphic design theory without any external frameworks or modules. For this project the application Coffee Clicker has been developed,
the purpose of the game is to click on a coffee cup and gain clicks through this interaction. The game is endless and the user can buy upgrades that, in theory, upgrades the amount of clicks gains per interaction.

## How to run 
To run the program you have to download the Processing IDE, this can be done at https://processing.org/.
After downloading the IDE you can open any file in the main folder, this will open all the tabs in the IDE.
When all the tabs are opened in the IDE the program can be executed by pressing the play button in the top left corner of the IDE.

## Plattform
The program is developed in Processing (java). This is due to Processing being a popular choice for creating graphic interfaces with little to none backend implementation, which is in line with the project requirements. There were both advantages and disadvantages using Processing. Processing is rather friendly to beginners and it is fairly easy to learn the ways of the plattform, hence there is a quick learning curve. Furthermore, the plattform has many built in functions and examples that make it easier to get inspiration and get started with a project. Some disadvantages include not being able to integrate github with development in processing, meaning once code has been written it has to be transferred to a editor, such as Visual Studio Code, and then pushed to the github repo. This made it rather cumbersome to collaborate on specific module of the application. Finally the error messages in Processing IDE lack the details needed to debug easily, the error messages mostly gave the error type and no indication in what line or tab the error occured.
